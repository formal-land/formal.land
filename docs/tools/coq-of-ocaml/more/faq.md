Here we answer to some questions you may have when using `coq-of-ocaml`.

## Why is there an `-impredicative-set` option to Coq?
To compile the files generated by `coq-of-ocaml`, we need to use the `-impredicative-set` option with Coq. The [Impredicative Set](https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/Impredicative-Set) page of the Coq wiki gives some details about this option. The reason for that is to avoid getting into universe inconsistency errors. If we take the following example:
```ocaml
type t =
  | Empty
  | Node : 'a -> t

(* This function could be a deserializing function from [string] to [t]. We
   use lists for the sake of simplicity. *)
let rec t_of_list (l : 'a list) : t =
  match l with
  | [] -> Empty
  | _ :: l -> Node (t_of_list l)
```
we generate the Coq translation:
```coq
Require Import CoqOfOCaml.CoqOfOCaml.
Require Import CoqOfOCaml.Settings.

Inductive t : Set :=
| Empty : t
| Node : forall {a : Set}, a -> t.

Fixpoint t_of_list {a : Set} (l : list a) : t :=
  match l with
  | [] => Empty
  | cons _ l => Node (t_of_list l)
  end.
```
The type `t` has a constructor `Node` with an existential type `a`. With the function `t_of_list` we generate a value with a number of nested existential types equals to the length of the list `l`. This generated Coq code is valid.

In contrast, if we were using `Type` instead of `Set` this would not work. Indeed, an existential type increases the universe level by one in `Type`. So this function would have a universe level for its result equals to the length on the list. This does not seem easy to express, even with polymorphic universes.
