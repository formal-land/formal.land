There are two main ways to customize the translation made by `coq-of-ocaml`:

- [Attributes](options/attributes): to add annotations to the OCaml code and change the translation at specific points in the code.
- [Configuration](options/configuration): to change the default behavior of `coq-of-ocaml` for the whole translation.
