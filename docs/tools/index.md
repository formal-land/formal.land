We develop open-source tools to translate programs from various languages to the [Rocq](https://rocq-prover.org/) proof assistant, enabling formal verification of your code.

## 🦀 rocq-of-rust

[**rocq-of-rust**](https://github.com/formal-land/rocq-of-rust) translates Rust programs to Rocq for formal verification.

**Funded by:** [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/) and [Aleph Zero Foundation](https://alephzero.org/)

## 🐫 coq-of-ocaml

[**coq-of-ocaml**](https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-ocaml) transpiles OCaml programs to Rocq. It was originally developed for the Tezos blockchain and has been used to verify over 100,000 lines of OCaml code. It supports advanced features like functors, first-class modules, and GADTs.

**Funded by:** French Government and [Tezos Foundation](https://tezos.foundation/)
