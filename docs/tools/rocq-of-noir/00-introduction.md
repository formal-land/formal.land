[**coq-of-noir**](https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-noir) is a **formal verification** tool for [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/) programs. With it you can ensure that Noir programs are totally bug-free and secure, assuming a correct specification!

It works by converting Noir programs to the [🐓&nbsp;Rocq](https://rocq-prover.org/) proof assistant in a shallow embedding, after the monomorphization phase of the Noir compiler which removes that generics and the traits.

To secure your Noir application to highest possible standard of safety, [📧&nbsp;contact us](mailto:&#099;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#097;&#099;&#116;&#064;formal&#046;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#100;)!
