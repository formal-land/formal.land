# ðŸ‘¥ About
We started as a company in **November 2021**, and are now a team of **six people**. We work primarily on the formal verification of the crypto-currency [Tezos](https://tezos.com/). We made and use the translator [coq-of-ocaml](https://foobar-land.github.io/coq-of-ocaml/) from the [OCaml language](https://ocaml.org/) to the proof system [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/). This allows us to verify properties about the kernel of Tezos, composed of around **80,000 lines of code**. We publish our results on the website of the project [coq-tezos-of-ocaml](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/).
