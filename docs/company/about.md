# ü¶ö About

We started in 2021. We specialize in **formal verification**, that is to say the <em>exhaustive testing of programs</em>, with a focus on the **blockchain industry**. We develop **innovative solutions&nbsp;üöÄ** to verify code that was unverifiable before. Most of our code is eventually **[open-sourced](https://github.com/formal-land)** and relies on the proof assistant <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq&nbsp;üêì</a>.

Exhaustively testing a program is a difficult task, as the set of possible program inputs is generally **infinite&nbsp;‚ôæÔ∏è**. With formal verification, we make a **mathematical analysis** of the code to ensure that it behaves as expected in all possible situations. As this mathematical analysis is complex, we use the **proof system Coq** to make sure that our reasoning is correct. You can then replay these proofs on your computer to **verify our claims**. When the code changes, we can **replay existing proofs** to check if nothing broke. This contrast with manual code audits where you must redo all the verification work for code upgrades.

Here are our main past and current projects:

- [coq-tezos-of-ocaml](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/) for the formal verification of the code of the L1 of the Tezos blockchain,
- [coq-of-rust](https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-rust) a tool to formally verify Rust programs,
- [coq-of-python](https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-python) a tool to formally verify Python programs and specify the [reference implementation](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs) of the EVM (the virtual machine for the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)'s smart contracts).
