# About
The company [Foobar Land](/) was founded by [Guillaume Claret](https://github.com/clarus) who made the translator [coq-of-ocaml](https://foobar-land.github.io/coq-of-ocaml/) from the [OCaml language](https://ocaml.org/) to the proof system [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/). Thanks to this tool, we are able to [formally verify properties](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/) about the kernel of the crypto-currency [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) composed of around 40,000 lines of OCaml code.

We are a team of three people and working on the formal verification of Tezos.
