# üõ°Ô∏è Audit Reports

## Reports

Here are reports about formal verification works we have done, using the [üêì&nbsp;Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof system:

- <a href="/reports/sui-type-checker/book/">Sui: the type-checker for Move</a> (ongoing, Rust)
- <a href="/reports/smoo.th/book/">Smoo.th elliptic curve library</a> (Solidity)
- <a href="/reports/aleph-zero/book/">Aleph Zero: `coq-of-rust` and `coq-of-solidity`</a> (Rust/Solidity)
- <a href="/reports/tezos/book/">Tezos: parts of the L1</a> (OCaml)

## Get Started

We propose **code audits** with **formal verification** for **Solidity/Rust/Go** projects (L1, L2, and smart contracts) as:

- a **one-time audit** to verify your code at a specific point in time, for **$20** per line of code,
- a **subscription** to verify your code as it evolves,
- **consulting** to train you to use our tools or formal verification in general.

We offer **start-of-the-art security** with **formal verification** and **[interactive theorem proving](https://coq.inria.fr/)** to cover all possible code executions for any forms of user/security requirements.

Even **state actors cannot break** security properties as the protection is a **mathematical proof checked by a computer&nbsp;ü¶∏**.

Our verifications process **follows code changes** to verify only what changed. This means that you save money&nbsp;üí∞ compared to traditional audits, where you have to review everything for each release.

Our tools are **open source**, documented, and available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/formal-land). We rely on the proof system Coq&nbsp;üêì which is one of the most widely taught proof systems across the world&nbsp;üåè, so that you can maintain our work on your side.

The typical price for our audit subscription is **$15,000 per month**, for one **engineer** available full time for your project to **specify and formally verify your code**. You can stop the subscription at any time or have someone half-time for half the price.
