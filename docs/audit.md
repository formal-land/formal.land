# üõ°Ô∏è Audits

We propose **code audits** for **Solidity/Rust/Go** projects as a **subscription**. We claim to have the **best auditing approach** as we use **formal verification** with an **interactive theorem prover** to cover all possible code executions for any forms of user/security specifications.

We use the interactive theorem prover [Coq&nbsp;üêì](https://coq.inria.fr/) to make sure we can express and **verify any specifications**. We **verify the actual code** that will then be deployed in production thanks to tools automatically translating your code to the Coq proof system.

We design our verifications so that it can **follow code changes** without having to re-verify everything. This is a **huge advantage** over traditional audits. The formal specifications and proofs can then be integrated into a CI to make sure your code stays fully correct&nbsp;üîÑ.

All our tools are **open source** and available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/formal-land) so that you can use them by yourself. We encourage other teams or auditors to do so. The main requirement is to be knowledgeable in the Coq theorem prover. We believe formal verification audits are a requirement as **state actors have this capability**.

The price for our audit subscription is **$25,000 per month**, for a team of **a few engineers** available full time for your project to **specify and formally verify your code**. You can stop the subscription at any time. We refund one year back in time if a critical vulnerability is still found or if you find stronger audit methods.
