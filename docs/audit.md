# 🛡️ Audits

We propose **code audits** as a **subscription** for **Solidity/Rust/Go** projects such as L1, L2, and smart contracts. We offer **start-of-the-art security** with **formal verification** and **[interactive theorem proving](https://coq.inria.fr/)** to cover all possible code executions for any forms of user/security requirements.

Even **state actors cannot break** security properties as the protection is a **mathematical proof checked by a computer&nbsp;🦸**.

Our verifications process **follows code changes** to verify only what changed. Compared to traditional audits, you can integrate formal specification into your CI to make sure your code stays fully correct&nbsp;🔄.

Our tools are **open source**, documented, and available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/formal-land). We rely on the proof system Coq&nbsp;🐓 which is one of the most widely taught proof systems in Universities across the world&nbsp;🌏.

The price for our audit subscription is **$12,000 per month**, for one **engineer** available full time for your project to **specify and formally verify your code**. You can stop the subscription at any time. Our price per line of code we verify is **&#36;15**.
