# 🐫 OCaml development

We offer our [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) (or [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/)/[ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/)/[Melange](https://github.com/melange-re/melange)) **development services**. We work as contractors and our unique rate is **$10,000 per month all inclusive**. Our work can be terminated **without notice period** on your side. Some of our developers have more than **10 years of experience** in software development, either in **embedded systems** or in **Web applications (front and back)**. We strive to follow **strict schedule** and fulfill all **customer requirements**.

```ocaml
  return (LetVar (None, x, typ_params, e1, e2))
| Match (e, dep_match, cases, is_with_default_case) ->
  let* cases =
    cases
    |> Monad.List.map (fun (p, existential_cast, e) ->
            let* e = smart_return operator e in
```

An example of our work is the development of [coq-of-ocaml](https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-ocaml), a tool to translate OCaml code to the [Coq proof system 🐓](https://coq.inria.fr/). We use it to formally verify the implementation of the Tezos crypto-currency ꜩ, composed of 100,000 lines of OCaml. This project is named [Coq Tezos of OCaml](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/). As such, we also offer formal verification services on OCaml, and can both develop and verify a project.
