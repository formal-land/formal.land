Some of our developers have more than **10 years of experience** in software development, either in **embedded systems** or in **Web applications (front and back)**. We strive to follow **strict schedule** and fulfill all **customer requirements**.

```solidity
function winningProposal() public view
        returns (uint winningProposal_)
{
    uint winningVoteCount = 0;
    for (uint p = 0; p < proposals.length; p++) {
        if (proposals[p].voteCount > winningVoteCount) {
            winningVoteCount = proposals[p].voteCount;
            winningProposal_ = p;
```

We have experience in crypto-currencies and the development of secure protocols working for the auditing and formal verification of the Tezos blockchain with the project [Coq Tezos of OCaml](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/). We are currently running a program to make new formal verification tools for Solidity. Get more information on [this page](/docs/verification/solidity).
