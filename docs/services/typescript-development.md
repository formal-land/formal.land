# 🇹 TypeScript development

We offer our [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) development services (or in [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/)/[ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/)/[Melange](https://github.com/melange-re/melange) languages that are close). We work as contractors and our work can be terminated without notice period. <!-- Our rate is $12,000 per month all inclusive. --> Some of our developers have more than 10 years of experience in software development, either in embedded systems or in Web applications (front and back). We strive to follow schedule and fulfill requirements.

An example of our work is the development of [coq-of-ocaml](https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-ocaml), a tool to translate OCaml code to the [Coq proof system 🐓](https://coq.inria.fr/). We use it to formally verify the implementation of the Tezos crypto-currency ꜩ, composed of 100,000 lines of OCaml. This project is named [Coq Tezos of OCaml](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/). As such, we also offer formal verification services on OCaml, and can do both at the same time (develop OCaml code and formally verify it). It is generally easier to code and verify at the same time, to have code written in a style that simplifies the proofs.
