# 🌐 TypeScript development

We offer our [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) development services&nbsp;🏗️ to help you build your applications. We work as contractors and our work can be terminated without notice period on your side&nbsp;🔥. <!-- Our rate is $12,000 per month all inclusive. --> Some of our developers have more than 10 years of experience in software development&nbsp;🧓, either in embedded systems or in Web applications (front and back). We strive to follow schedule&nbsp;⏲️ and fulfill requirements.

For those who might be interested, we have an internal research project [🔍&nbsp;TypeScript verification](/docs/verification/typescript) aiming to drastically improve the testing and QA on TypeScript code thanks to the use of formal methods.
