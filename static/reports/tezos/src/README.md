# Presentation

We worked for the formal verification of parts of the L1 of the [Tezos blockchain](https://tezos.com/) for two grants with the [Tezos Foundation](https://tezos.foundation/) of four months each.

The end result is on this website: [https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/) It includes a blog associated with the project describing the technical progress and the challenges we faced, as well as a link to the source code of the project. Everything is open-source under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit).
