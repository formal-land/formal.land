Here we recall some blog articles that we have written since this summer, on the [formal verification of the protocol of Tezos](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/). For this project, we are verifying a code base of around 100,000 lines of OCaml code. We automatically convert the OCaml code to the proof system Coq using the converter [coq-of-ocaml](https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-ocaml). We then apply various proof techniques to make sure that the protocol of Tezos does not contain bugs.

## Blog articles üìù
Here is the list of articles about the work we have done since this summer. We believe that some of this work is very unique and specific to Tezos.

* [The error monad, internal errors and validity predicates, step-by-step](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2022/12/12/internal-errors-step-by-step/) by *Pierre Vial*: a detailed explanation of what we are doing to verify the absence of unexpected errors in the whole code base;
* [Absence of internal errors](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2022/10/18/absence-of-internal-errors/) by *Guillaume Claret*: the current state of our proofs to verify the absence of unexpected errors;
* [Skip-list verification. Using inductive predicates](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2022/10/03/verifying-the-skip-list-inductive-predicates/) by *Bart≈Çomiej Kr√≥likowski* and *Natalie Klaus*: a presentation of our verification effort on the skip-list algorithm implementation (part 2);
* [Verifying the skip-list](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2022/10/03/verifying-the-skip-list/) by *Natalie Klaus* and *Bart≈Çomiej Kr√≥likowski*: a presentation of our verification effort on the skip-list algorithm implementation (part 1);
* [Verifying json-data-encoding](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2022/08/15/verify-json-data-encoding/) by *Tait van Strien*: our work to verify an external library used by the Tezos protocol, to safely serialize data to JSON values;
* [Fixing reused proofs](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2022/07/19/fixing-proofs/) by *Bart≈Çomiej Kr√≥likowski*: a presentation, with examples, of the work we do to maintain existing proofs and specifications as the code evolves;
* [Formal verification of property based tests](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2022/06/07/formal-verification-of-property-based-tests/) by *Guillaume Claret*: the principle and status of our work to formally verify the generalized case of property-based tests;
* [Plan for backward compatibility verification](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2022/06/02/plan-backward-compatibility) by *Guillaume Claret*: an explanation of the strategy we use to show that two successive versions of the Tezos protocol are fully backward compatible.
