Recently, we added two new blog posts about the verification of the crypto-currency [Tezos](https://tezos.com/):
* [Verify the Michelson types of Mi-Cho-Coq](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2021/11/01/verify-michelson-types-mi-cho-coq/) to compare the types defined in the Tezos code for the [Michelson](http://tezos.gitlab.io/active/michelson.html) interpreter and in the [Mi-Cho-Coq library](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/mi-cho-coq) to verify smart contracts;
* [Translate the Tenderbake's code to Coq](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2021/11/08/translate-tenderbake/) to explain how we translated the recent changes in Tezos to the Coq using [coq-of-ocaml](https://github.com/foobar-land/coq-of-ocaml). In particular we translated the code of the new [Tenderbake](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/a-look-ahead-to-tenderbake.html) consensus algorithm.

We also talked at the [Lambda Lille Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/LambdaLille/events/281374644/) (in French) to present our work on `coq-of-ocaml` for Tezos. A video on the [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-hC7y_ilQBq0QCa9xDu1iA) of the Meetup should be available shortly. We thanks the organizers for hosting the talk.
