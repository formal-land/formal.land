We bring you the **highest possible level of security&nbsp;🦸** for your blockchain applications by using **formal verification&nbsp;✨** optimized by **AI solutions** to keep the cost down. We believe that for systems **holding a lot of value&nbsp;💰**, it is necessary to use the most advanced techniques&nbsp;⚛️ to ensure their security; otherwise attackers with large means (like **North Korea&nbsp;🇰🇵**, but not only) will be able to **steal or damage** the system by using these techniques themselves.

In this blog post we present how we work with customers to integrate full formal verification in their workflow and ensure that their code is **secure** in the best possible way.

<!-- It is possible to have a system which is fully secured&nbsp;💯 once you have a mathematical proof of its security that is itself verified by a computer. This is what we provide with **formal verification**. In some sense this is good to know there is an end to the quest of finding security vulnerabilities . The issue is that formal verification is only as good as the **scope** of the code we verify, and the quality of the **security predicates** that we use. -->

To ensure your code is secure today, contact us at&nbsp;[&nbsp;💌&#099;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#097;&#099;&#116;&#064;formal&#046;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#100;](mailto:contact@formal.land)!&nbsp;🚀

Formal verification goes further than traditional audits to make 100% sure you cannot lose your funds, thanks to **mathematical reasoning on the code**. It can be integrated into your CI pipeline to check that every commit is fully correct **without doing a whole audit again**.

We make bugs such as the [DAO hack](https://www.gemini.com/fr-fr/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao) ($60 million stolen) virtually **impossible to happen again**.

## 🛡️ Why Formal Verification Matters

Security is central to the long term success of decentralized platforms. Traditional testing or security audits can catch many issues, but are not enough to guarantee the absence of bugs. Formal verification is a technique that **checks every possible input** of your program to ensure that it is always correct, for a given set of security properties. It works by mathematically reasoning about the code constructs and then checking this reasoning with a computer.

## 🔄 Our Process

Our process is as follows:

1. **Understanding Your Needs** We start by meeting with you to understand your system and your security requirements.
2. **Formal Modeling** We then create a formal model of your system in a proof assistant, using automated translation tools to make sure we make no mistakes.
3. **Proof Generation** We then generate mathematical proofs that your system satisfies the security properties you require, using the latest techniques in proof automation to reduce the cost.
4. **Seamless Integration** We help you integrate the proofs into your CI pipeline to ensure that every commit is automatically checked for correctness.

## 🎁 Benefits You Can Expect

* **Enhanced Security** You improve the security of your system by showing that whole classes of bugs are impossible.
* **Cost Savings** You prevent costly security incidents and reduce the need for extensive manual audits.
* **Investor Confidence** You demonstrate that your system is secure and that you protect your users.
* **Regulatory Compliance** Finally, you show that you have taken all necessary steps to meet regulatory requirements.

## 🌐 Why Choose Us?

* **Expert Team** Our team has years of experience in formal verification, cryptography, and A, with publications in all of these domains.
