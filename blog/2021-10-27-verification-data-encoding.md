We added a blog post about the [verification of the use of data-encodings](https://formal-land.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2021/10/20/data-encoding-usage) in the protocol of Tezos. Currently, we work on the verification of Tezos and publish our blog articles there. We use [coq-of-ocaml](https://foobar-land.github.io/coq-of-ocaml/) to translate the OCaml code to Coq and do our verification effort.
