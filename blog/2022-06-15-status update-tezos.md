Here we give an update on our verification effort on the protocol of Tezos. We add the marks:
* ‚úÖ for "rather done"
* üåä for "partially done"
* ‚ùå for "most is yet to do"

## Maintenance of the translation ‚úÖ
We were able to successfully maintain the translation from OCaml to Coq of the protocol of Tezos using [coq-of-ocaml](https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-ocaml). There was an increase of the size of the OCaml code base in recent months, due to new features added in Tezos, especially the [rollups](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/tezos-is-scaling.html). Here are the numbers of lines of code (`.ml` and `.mli` files) for the various protocol versions:
* protocol H: `51147`
* protocol I: `59535`
* protocol J: `83271` (increase mainly due to the rollups)
* protocol Alpha (development version of K): `90716`

We still translate most of the protocol code up to the version J. We stayed on the version J for a while as we wanted to add as many proofs as possible before doing a proof of backward compatibility between J and K. We are currently updating the translation to support the protocol version Alpha.

For the protocol J, we needed to add a [blacklist.txt](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/-/blob/master/blacklist.txt) of files that we do not support. Indeed, we need to add new changes to `coq-of-ocaml` to support these or do hard-to-maintain changes to [our fork](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/3303) of the Tezos protocol. We plan to complete the translation and remove this black-list for the protocol J soon (in a week or two).

## Size of the proofs ‚úÖ
One of our plans is to have a reasonable quantity of proofs, to cover a reasonable quantity of code and properties from the protocol. We believe we have a good quantity of proofs now, as we have more than 50,000 lines of Coq code (for an OCaml codebase of 80,000 lines).

In addition to our main targets, we verify many "smaller" properties, such that:
* conversion functions are inverses (when there are two `to_int` and `of_int` functions in a file, we show that they are inverses);
* the `compare` functions, to order elements, are well defined (see our blog post [Verifying the compare functions of OCaml](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2022/04/04/verifying-the-compare-functions));
* invariants are preserved. For example, [here](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/docs/proofs/carbonated_map#Make.update_is_valid) we show that updating a carbonated map preserves the property of having a size field actually equal to the number of elements.

## Data-encodings üåä
The [data-encoding](https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/data-encoding) library is a set of combinators to write serialization/de-serialization functions. We verify that the encodings defined for each protocol data types are bijective. The good thing we have is a semi-automated tactic to verify the use of the `data-encoding` primitives. We detail this approach in our blog post [Automation of `data_encoding` proofs](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2021/11/22/data-encoding-automation). We are able to verify most of the encoding functions that we encounter. From there, we also express the **invariant** associated to each data type, that the encodings generally check at runtime. The invariants are then the domain of definition of the encodings.

However we have a hole: we do not verify the `data-encoding` library itself. Thus the [axioms we made](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/docs/environment/proofs/data_encoding) on the data-encoding primitives may have approximations. And indeed, we missed one issue in development code of the protocol. This is a new target to also verify the library itself. One of the challenges for the proof is the use of side-effects (references and exceptions) in this library.

## Property-based tests üåä
The property-based tests on the protocol are located in [`src/proto_alpha/lib_protocol/test/pbt`](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/tree/master/src/proto_alpha/lib_protocol/test/pbt). These tests are composed of:
* a generator, generating random inputs of a certain shape;
* a property function, a boolean function taking a generated input and supposed to always answer `true`.

We translated a part of these tests to Coq, to convert them to theorems and have specifications extracted from the code. The result of this work is summarized in this blog post: [Formal verification of property based tests](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/blog/2022/06/07/formal-verification-of-property-based-tests). We have fully translated and verified four test files over a total of twelve. We are continuing the work of translations and proofs.

However, we found that for some of the files the proofs were taking a long time to write compared to the gains in safety. Indeed, the statements made in the tests are sometimes too complex when translated to general theorems. For example, in [test_carbonated_map.ml](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/blob/master/src/proto_alpha/lib_protocol/test/pbt/test_carbonated_map.ml) we have to deal in the proofs with:
* gas exhaustion (seemingly impossible in the tests);
* data structures of size greater than `max_int` (impossible in practice).

All of that complicate the proofs for little gain in safety. So I would say that not all the property-based tests have a nice and useful translation to Coq. We should still note that for some of the tests, like with saturation arithmetic, we have proofs that work well. This is in part thanks to the automated linear arithmetic tactic [`lia`](https://coq.inria.fr/refman/addendum/micromega.html) of Coq.

## Storage system üåä
By "storage system" we understand the whole set of functors defined in [`storage_functors.ml`](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/blob/master/src/proto_alpha/lib_protocol/storage_functors.ml) and how we apply them to define the protocol storage in [`storage.ml`](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/blob/master/src/proto_alpha/lib_protocol/storage_functors.ml). These functors create sub-storages with signatures such as:
```ocaml
module type Non_iterable_indexed_data_storage = sig
  type t
  type context = t
  type key
  type value
  val mem : context -> key -> bool Lwt.t
  val get : context -> key -> value tzresult Lwt.t
  val find : context -> key -> value option tzresult Lwt.t
  val update : context -> key -> value -> Raw_context.t tzresult Lwt.t
  val init : context -> key -> value -> Raw_context.t tzresult Lwt.t
  val add : context -> key -> value -> Raw_context.t Lwt.t
  val add_or_remove : context -> key -> value option -> Raw_context.t Lwt.t
  val remove_existing : context -> key -> Raw_context.t tzresult Lwt.t
  val remove : context -> key -> Raw_context.t Lwt.t
end
```
This `Non_iterable_indexed_data_storage` API looks like the API of an OCaml's [Map](https://v2.ocaml.org/api/Map.Make.html). As a result, our goal for the storage is to show that is can be simulated by standard OCaml data structures such as sets and maps. This is a key step to unlock further reasoning about code using the storage.

Unfortunately, we were not able to verify yet the whole storage system. Among the difficulties are that:
* there are many layers in the definition of the storage;
* the storage functors use a lot of abstractions, and sometimes it is unclear how to specify them in the general case.

Still, we have verified some of the functors as seen in [`Proofs/Storage_functors.v`](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/docs/proofs/storage_functors) and specified the `storage.ml` file in [`Proos/Storage.v`](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/docs/storage). We believe to have the correct specifications for all of the storage abstractions now. We plan to complete all these proofs later.

## Michelson
The verification of the Michelson interpreter is what occupied most of our time. By considering the OCaml files whose name start by `script_`, the size of the Michelson interpreter is around 20,000 lines of OCaml code.

### Simulations üåä
The interpreter relies heavily on [GADTs](https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/gadts.html) in OCaml. Because these do not translate nicely in Coq, we need to write simulations in dependent types of the interpreter functions, and prove them correct in Coq. We describe this process in our [Michelson Guide](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/docs/guides/michelson).

The main difficulties we encountered are:
* the number of simulations to write (covering the 20,000 lines of OCaml);
* the execution time of the proof of correctness of the simulations. This is due to the large size of the inductive types describing the Michelson AST, and the use of dependent types generating large proof terms. For example, there are around 30 cases for the types and 150 for the instructions node in the AST.

When writing the simulations, we are also verifying the termination of all the functions and the absence of reachable `assert false`. We have defined the simulation of many functions, but are still missing important ones such as [`parse_instr_aux`](https://nomadic-labs.gitlab.io/coq-tezos-of-ocaml/docs/script_ir_translator/#parse_instr_aux) to parse Michelson programs.
